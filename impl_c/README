The C implementation can be compiled on a system by running `make`.
The system must be POSIX complicant and must have gcc installed.

The programs read a file named `input.dat` in the working directory to gather the initial data.
An example set of 256 elements can be found in the parent directory (input.dat.example)
Binaries are provided, but they are formatted for ELF x86 and will not run on Windows systems unless recompiled.
