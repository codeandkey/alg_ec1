Extra Credit - Selection Sort

In this extra credit submission I implemented the selection sort and bubble sort algorithms and analysed the performance for input size.
I implemented the algorithm in Python and ISO C99, and performance for both languages is considered when performing the computation analysis.

The minimum analysis for the extra-credit assignment requirements is on the first page of the analysis (although an explanation for the results can be seen at the end of the paper).

Both implementations read a file of 32-bit unsigned integers named `input.dat` to sort.

The results are in the `results` directory.
